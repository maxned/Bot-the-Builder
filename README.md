# Bot-the-Builder
We plan to build a fault recovery **Bot**! *beep beep*

**Changelog**
-----
1. We are now focusing on  having the bot accomplish a goal such as build 20 marines by a certain unit of time.
2. We will be branching off into Q-learning ~~and the use of [Weka]~~ to determine the outcomes that a player should take.
3. We have decided to implement K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) in order to deterimne the probability 
of a player winning at any given time. 

Replay Parser
---
* The parser iterates over the 1k+ replays selecting 91 predetermined labels
* It dumps the data of the 91 lables by time step into a csv file `"Units-1311.csv"`
* It is also used to parse through the replay which we want to make predictions into another csv file `"parsed_replay.csv"`


Q-Learning
---
* We need a Q-table to store the possible actions the bot will take
* Possible actions: `build_barracks()`, `build_workers()`
* Randomly select which action to take at each step 
* We plan on using **Q-learning** to teach the bot how to reach this goal.
* We run multiple iterations of the game in order to **train** the bot on the best sequence to reach this goal.
* We then **test** the bot by having it run through until it reaches its goal.

K-Nearest Neighbor
---
* We parse over 1k replays saving at every predetermined time interval  
* We select 91 labels of interest such as *Barracks*, *BarracksTechLab*, etc. to help create the model
* The 92<sup>nd</sup> label is the win label which will be used as our Y value
* The parsed replays are dumped into a *.csv* file which are loaded into a *pandas* `DataFrame`
* The `DataFrame` is sliced to fit the requirements of **Scikit-learn's** `KNeighborsClassifier` algorithm
* Export into 4 different csv files pertaining to different values of *k: 5, 10, 15, 20*

Graphing GUI
---
* We created a GUI using *Tkinter* and *matplotlib* to plot the probailities of a win while monitoring a replay 
* The GUI uploads the multiple csv files generated by the KNN script and plots the values
* x-axis: the time step of the replay
* y-axis: the probability of the win given a particular *k* value 


~~Weka~~
---
- ~~Gather large amounts of replay data~~
- ~~Determine which points of data to retrieve and dump into a csv file~~
- ~~Upload csv file to Weka GUI~~
