# Bot-the-Builder
Implement a bot which will "*learn*" how to build a predetermined amount of marines. Along with a q-learning bot we  provide feedback on a replay in terms of probability of winning per time step.

**Changelog**
-----
1. We are now focusing on  having the bot accomplish a goal such as build 20 marines by a certain unit of time.
2. We will be branching off into Q-learning ~~and the use of [Weka]~~ to determine the outcomes that a player should take.
3. We have decided to implement K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) in order to deterimne the probability 
of a player winning at any given time. 

Replay Parser
---
* The parser iterates over the 1k+ replays selecting 91 predetermined labels
* It dumps the data of the 91 lables by time step into a csv file `"Units-1311.csv"`
* It is also used to parse through the replay which we want to make predictions into another csv file `"parsed_replay.csv"`

K-Nearest Neighbor
---
* We parse over 1k replays saving at every predetermined time interval  
* We select 91 labels of interest such as *Barracks*, *BarracksTechLab*, etc. to help create the model
* The 92<sup>nd</sup> label is the win label which will be used as our Y value
* The parsed replays are dumped into a *.csv* file which are loaded into a *pandas* `DataFrame`
* The `DataFrame` is sliced to fit the requirements of **Scikit-learn's** `KNeighborsClassifier` algorithm
* Export into 4 different csv files pertaining to different values of *k: 5, 10, 15, 20*

Graphing GUI
---
* We created a GUI using *Tkinter* and *matplotlib* to plot the probailities of a win while monitoring a replay 
* The GUI uploads the multiple csv files generated by the KNN script and plots the values
* x-axis: the time step of the replay
* y-axis: the probability of the win given a particular *k* value 

Q-Learning
---
* Try to build 20 marines as fast and as efficiently as possible using Q learning.
* For more information, visit the README in the Q Learning folder.

~~Weka~~
---
- ~~Gather large amounts of replay data~~
- ~~Determine which points of data to retrieve and dump into a csv file~~
- ~~Upload csv file to Weka GUI~~
