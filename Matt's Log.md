# Wednesday May 9th
	- Created and ran PySC2 tutorial on basic 64x64 test map 
	- Created multiple trials and made slight modifications to code to observe AI behavior
	- Marked up code with comments in a format that was easier for teammates to understand what
	the AI was actually doing with each line of the script
	- Created new branch "Matt" on github repository with work-in-progress tutorials

# Friday May 11th
	- Talked with Dr. McCoy about q-learning time constraints for implementing our fault detection algorithms
	- Discussed the possibility of using Weka, a java machine learning library that will dynamically create a build order
	- Through using Weka, we hope to generate a builder order with efficiency equivalent to one designed by professional 
	Starcraft 2 players. 
	- Made plans to playtest the builds generated by Weka and demo them for the final presentation

# Monday May 14
	- Downloaded Weka and added a basic tutorial
	- Currently working on integrating Starcraft 2 logic into Weka 

# Tuesday May 15
	- Met with Dr. McCoy again and discussed inputs and outputs to Weka 
	- Talked about alternate strategies to accomplish what we needed to do, decided that Weka might not actually be needed
	- Changed project direction -> parse Starcraft 2 replays using python command line tool and generate an AI that creates it's own build orders by ranking successful and unsuccessful actions in professional games, with data we gather from using this tool.

# Sunday May 20
	- Attempted to install s2protocol: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2protocol to parse through replays
	- Had missing package dependencies that couldn't be installed from pip
	- Planning to check in with Dr. McCoy for potential alternatives
