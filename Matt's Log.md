# Wednesday May 9th
	- Created and ran PySC2 tutorial on basic 64x64 test map 
	- Created multiple trials and made slight modifications to code to observe AI behavior
	- Marked up code with comments in a format that was easier for teammates to understand what
	the AI was actually doing with each line of the script
	- Created new branch "Matt" on github repository with work-in-progress tutorials

# Friday May 11th
	- Talked with Dr. McCoy about q-learning time constraints for implementing our fault detection algorithms
	- Discussed the possibility of using Weka, a java machine learning library that will dynamically create a build order
	- Through using Weka, we hope to generate a builder order with efficiency equivalent to one designed by professional 
	Starcraft 2 players. 
	- Made plans to playtest the builds generated by Weka and demo them for the final presentation

# Monday May 14
	- Downloaded Weka and added a basic tutorial
	- Currently working on integrating Starcraft 2 logic into Weka
